# Step 1 - Load the Data
air <- data.frame(airquality)
head(air)

# Step 2 - Clean the Data
colSums(air)
air$Ozone[is.na(air$Ozone)] <- mean(air$Ozone, na.rm = T)
air$Solar.R[is.na(air$Solar.R)] <- mean(air$Solar.R, na.rm = T)
head(air)

# Step 3 - Understand the data distribution
ggplot(air, aes(Ozone)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(air, aes(Solar.R)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(air, aes(Wind)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(air, aes(Temp)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(air, aes(Month)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(air, aes(Day)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(air, aes(Ozone)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(air, aes(as.factor(Ozone), Wind)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(air, aes(as.factor(Wind), Ozone)) + geom_boxplot()

# Step 4 - Explore how the data changes over time
air$Date <- as.Date(paste("1973", air$Month, air$Day, sep = "/"))
air$Wind <- air$Wind * 10
head(air)
ggplot(air, aes(Date, Ozone)) + geom_line()
ggplot(air, aes(Date, Solar.R)) + geom_line()
ggplot(air, aes(Date, Wind)) + geom_line()
ggplot(air, aes(Date, Temp)) + geom_line()
air2 <- data.frame(air$Ozone, air$Solar.R, air$Wind, air$Temp, air$Date)
air2 <- air[,c("Ozone", "Solar.R", "Wind", "Temp", "Date")]
head(air2)
melted <- melt(air2, id = "Date")
head(melted)
ggplot(melted, aes(Date, value, color = variable)) + geom_line()

# Step 5: Look at all the data via a heatmap
ggplot(melted, aes(Date, variable)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = value)) + scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "blue")

# Step 6: Look at all the data via a scatter chart
ggplot(air, aes(Wind, Temp)) + geom_point(aes(size = Ozone, color = Solar.R))

# Step 7: Final analysis
Honestly, I'm not sure what patterns to look for, but I think it's important to note that some variables are significantly influenced by each other based on the multiline chart, scatter chart, and heatmap.
Based on the multiline chart, I noted that solar radiation has the highest value, and ozone is strongly correlated with solar radiation as both are high in May and still are high in October.
It seems to me that the scatter chart indicates that low temperatures bring fast winds; the heatmap shows a strong correlation between ozone and temperature.
